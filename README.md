# Weather App

A simple weather app that displays the current weather for a given city. Built using Vite + React + TypeScript, with Tailwind CSS for styling, and Vitest for unit testing.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run the development server with `npm run dev`
4. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser (or another port if it's already in use.)

## Testing

Run tests with `npm run test`

## Key Features

- Fast development setup with [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite)
- Styling with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Unit testing with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
- Icons provided by [React Icons](https://github.com/react-icons/react-icons)

## Future plans

- Use a real weather API to get updated weather data.
  - Challenge: finding a way to retrieve city names from an API for autocompletion feature.
